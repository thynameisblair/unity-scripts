# unity-scripts
Assorted Unity scripts that I plug into Unity while I’m prototyping or doing other things.

## Loader.cs
Uses SceneManager to additively load one or more Scenes. You can use this to add functionality like “wait for all my scenes to be loaded before starting them” and “pass my scenes data so they have references to all my global scripts”.
